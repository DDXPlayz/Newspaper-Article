        The narrative shifted to the past, on the first of august 1939 shortly after Bruno’s<br>
         father received his new uniform which meant that he had been promoted to the commandant. <br>
         When Bruno’s father went home one evening, he was in a state of great excitement and announced <br>
         that “the fury” would come to dinner at the house on Thursday. Bruno asked who the “fury” was. <br>
         Father tried, and failed to correct Bruno's pronunciation of the word, Gretal explained that <br>
         “the fury” was the man who ran the country. Mother spent the next few days working diligently to <br>
         prepare the house to receive their guest, though she kept mentioning repeatedly that 'it would been a <br>
         great successive some people helped a little bit more around the house. In the hour before the man’s arrival, <br>
         Bruno and Gretel were brought downstairs dressed in their finest clothes. Bruno had a new pair of shoes given <br>
         to him and he was immensely proud of them even though they were too small for them, and they hurt him. <br>
         Father instructed them to talk to their guest only if he addressed them and to speak loudly and clearly like an adult. <br>
         Ground rules were set for the siblings <br><br>

  The fury arrived with his companion, Eva. The fury’s companion takes an <br>
  interest in the children and spoke with them at length. Bruno had found <br>
  "the fury "the rudest guest he had ever witnessed the fury then walked <br>
  into the dining room, took a seat in father’s chair, and impatiently called <br>
  Eva to come interrupting the talk Eva wanted to have with the siblings. <br>
  The guests stayed for two hours, and mother and father argued after they left. <br>
  A couple of days later, Bruno went home and found Maria packing his belongings and <br>
  even the things he had hidden behind that belonged to him. This was where the actual story began.<br><br>
